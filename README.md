# Generating_Express_Server
In this project, we are writing a python script that will read json objects in which information about different nodes is present. The python script will automatically generate an Express server and include different middlewares and routes.  

Project Requirements (dependencies) :
  1.  python must be installed in the directory that you use.
  2.  'node', 'express' and 'cors' must be installed in the output directory

How to install dependencies:
  1.  for node.js  => download and install node.js from 'https://nodejs.org/en/download'. After this setup environmental variables for node.js
  2.  for express and cors  =>
          a).  go to output directory where you want to save your express server js file.
      
          b).  open command prompt
      
          c).  run command 'npm install express cors'
